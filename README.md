This is a skin disease detection model using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
This project focused on Web Dev and AI/ML.
This project has accuracy of around 96 percent and it uses the CNN model to predict the disease using the preprocessed data taken from HAM10000 dataset.
It uses uses Node js for backend.
The website is implemented using Pug and Express.js
This model uses sequential model of auto keras.
In this model 25 percent data is tested and 75 percent is trained.
User profile is stored using Mongo Db.
